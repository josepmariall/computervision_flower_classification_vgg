### Image Classification (flower): Transfer Learning

The goal of this project is to create an algorithm to classify 5 types of flowers. 

Data set to be trained contains 3670 images, that shall be used for training and testing the model.

Transfer learning is a technique that allows use to use some state of the art CNN classifiers, such as VGG to create our own model.

In this study, I have used VGG, a model created with over 10 thousand images as features abstractor for the classification. 

In this project we shall fart, besides the datasets, the following documents:

1. Data Visualization & Preparation
2. Model â€“ Transfer Learning VGG

Note: environment for this project is provided as .yml file
