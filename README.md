# Flower classification using Transfer Learning
The goal of this project is to create an algorithm to classify 5 types of flowers. 

## Install
I provide the [environment](https://github.com/titoniubo/computervision_flower_classification_vgg/blob/master/cnn_environment.yml) used to run this code.

## About the project
Dataset to be trained contains 3670 images, that shall be used for training and testing the model.

Transfer learning is a technique that allows the use of some state-of-the-art CNN classifiers such as VGG, to create our own model.

In this study, I have used VGG, a model created with over 10 thousand images as features abstractor for the classification. 

In this project we shall find, besides the datasets, the following documents:

1. Data Visualization & Preparation
2. Model – Transfer Learning VGG
